<h1>The Best Video Games According to Matthew</h1>
<h2>My top 3 video games of all-time.</h2>
<p>
    There are so many amazing video games out there that it is so hard to pick favourites. <br/>
    Doom (1993) was the first ever video game I played and I love the entire series of releases. <br />
    The Wolfenstein series too! However, some of the best games I've ever played have been more recent.

<h3>Terraria</h3>
<p>
    This is my favourite game. I have invested more time than I would like to mention into the progression and the various features. <br />
    This game is satisfying, has a lot of replayability, and is enjoyed even more with the wide veriaty of community-made mods.

<h3>Wolfenstein - Enemy Territory</h3>
<p>
    An old but gold game. The simple shoot-em-up gameplay in a multiplayer matchup sometimes ends up with you finding friends and nemeses. <br />
    I ended up joining and socialising with various communities of people in the game, and even built my own. <br />
</p>
<h3>Genshin Impact</h3>
<p>
    A very beautiful, in-depth, open-world game with a long and immersive story and a lot of options when it comes to how you play it. <br />
    It's amazing figuring out how combinations of different characters, weapons and artifacts work best in different scenarios. <br />
    You'll find yourself emotionally invested in the charaters and stories of the world in this game, and all of a sudden there's an evening gone.
